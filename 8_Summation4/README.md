- [Subset sum problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)
  - For example, given the set {\displaystyle \{-7,-3,-2,5,8\}}{\displaystyle \{-7,-3,-2,5,8\}}, the answer is yes because the subset {\displaystyle \{-3,-2,5\}}{\displaystyle \{-3,-2,5\}} sums to zero. The problem is NP-complete, meaning roughly that while it is easy to confirm whether a proposed solution is valid, it may inherently be prohibitively difficult to determine in the first place whether any solution exists.
